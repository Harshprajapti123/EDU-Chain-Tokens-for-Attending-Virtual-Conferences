## Project Title
Tokens for Attending Virtual Conferences

## Project Description
This project incentivizes attendees of virtual conferences by awarding them tokens upon participation. The tokens, called Conference Attendance Tokens (CAT), serve as a proof of attendance and can be used for rewards or recognition within the event ecosystem. The smart contract enables token issuance, transfer, and management in a decentralized and secure manner.
